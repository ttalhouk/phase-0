*Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.*

In GitHub there is a + icon and one of the options is to create a repository.  Clicking on that will bring up the options for creating the new repository which include name, public/private, licenses, etc.  Once the repository is created a link is avaiable to it.  In the command line type `git clone [url]` and the repository and files within are cloned locally to the working directory.

*Describe what open source means.*

Open source means that the sorce code is available for others to look at, use and/or modify.

*What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?*

Open source is neat for collaborative works. It allows the community at that is interested in the code build upon it.  Though at a point one would need to protect their work which is where licenses come it.

*Assess the importance of using licenses.*

It's a way of deciding how users of the open source work can use the code.  This protects the creator of the original work.

*What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?*

I feel like I am begining to get the hang of the git workflow and navigating the command line a little better.  Though we have not had a project yet where two people are working on something which may through a bit more complexity into this.  If I have time at the end of the week I think I'll try to test how merging multiple branches working on the same file works.  This may be the focus of the blog assignment.

*Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.*

I did search for some more info on git to try and wrap my head around what is happening and got a few pices of info here and there but no silver bullets I'll need to research it a bit more.
