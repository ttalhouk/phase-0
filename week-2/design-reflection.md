**Overall Reflections**

This section was eye opening.  There is a lot of hidden information being portrayed through website design to guide the user experience.  These should be considered upfront and built into the desgin instead of trying to be brought in at the end.


*What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?*

1. **Info Gathering** : determine the purpose, goals, target, and content of the site.
2. **Stie Map** : determine what info goes where.
3. **Desgin** : determine the look and feel of the site based on step 1 target and purpose.
4. **Development** : develop the home page and a shell for the interior ones.
5. **Testing and Delivery** : check compatibilty issues and how it displays on mulitple browers/devices.
6. **Maintenance** : updating the site continually to keep info up to date and keep interest.

*What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?*

The primary goal of the site is to showcase my experience throught the DBC training and present the skills I learned in the best way possible.  It is inteneded to be a hub for my projects portfolio and ways to contact me for potential colaborators and employers.  

*What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?*

The target audience would be a potential employer who is interested in what type of skills I have as well as info about me.

*What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.*

Ideally they would be interested in what is new on the site and take a look at what I've been up to.  Should they be interested they can contact me to find out more about projects i'm working on.

*What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?*

Design and user experience is what keeps the visitor engaged with the site and wanting to look deeper into the site so it is important to take it into consideration.  Readablity is important so the letter color contrasting and font selection can make a big difference.  The site should also be cohesive so using complementery color scheme and layout help users interact.

*What is user experience design and why is it valuable?* 

It makes you think like the user and not just the developer.  You need to take peoples user experience into accout to help convey the message you are trying to present.  You also should consider accesiblity issues through the proper use of tags.

*Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?*
Many of the sites say the same thing but it helps reinforce the information.  It's hard to put context to some of the concepts since we are not to familiar with the HTML coding and what is and is not possible with the limited knowedege we have so far.
