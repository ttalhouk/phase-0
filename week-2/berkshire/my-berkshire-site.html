<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
*I really enjoyed it.  It was good to look at a site and try to figure out how it was done, then play around with the HTML tags to make it work
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
*I don't think we used many, but we probably could have split the page up to include <header> <footer> for the tile and leagal disclaimer
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
*We did well. We had to think ahead to what it could look like and not worry what the raw HTML code made it look like.  We broke the site into left and right div's to help set it up for CSS to center it.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
*HTML allows for linking documents together, but formatting is a bit of a chore.  Luckly from what I've been reading the symantic code allows you to break the site up a bit better to help format it later.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
*Truthfully I still have to look up some tags but as I write them it gets easier.  Practice makes perfect.
