<!-- Add your reflection here -->
<!-- # This challenge took me [1] hours. -->
 
 

<!--What did you learn about the DOM?-->

<!--We learned how to select different elements of the DOM and manipulate them based.  I can see -->
<!--how this could be useful when wanting to have a website interact with input as you can create -->
<!--variables and manipulate them in the background to do something to the page dynamically.-->


<!--What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?-->

<!--Selecting the nodes by ID and TagName is useful.-->
<!--If you are selecting Elements you need to specify which one you will be changing [] similar-->
<!--to an array.-->
<!--Templates are useful if you have some HTML you want to have added when a certian event occurs but -->
<!--have it hidden when it is not the time for it.-->
