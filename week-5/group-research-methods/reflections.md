#Research Methods Reflections#

*What was your experience like researching for Ruby methods. Did you find them quickly? How easy was it to implement once you found one?*

This was a bit of a time consuming project.  It was a bit difficult to read and understand exactly what was happening, plus it may take a few
methods combined to make it work.

*Did you find any methods you thought would work but didn't? What made you think they would work? How did you determine they didn't?*

I tried grep for the array which I found in the rubiest book, it seemed perfect , but when running the spec file it didn't 
work.  

*How does the method you chose iterate through and modify information in a data structure?*

The ones I found don't change the data, it only returns the data needed.  I created a holding array to contain the info I searched for.

*Is the method you implemented destructive or non-destructive?*

I used Non-destructive methods.

*What did you learn from reading your accountability-group member's explanations on their solutions?*

I completed the tasks first.  I will chime in on the discussion board and in slack.

*What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?*

It's difficult to explain some things but I will try to clarify if any questions come up in the discussion board.
