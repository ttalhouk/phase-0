*What does puts do?*

`puts` prints to the screen and adds a return ending the line.

*What is an integer? What is a float?*

An integer is a whole number that can be positive or negitive and include 0 when dividing it returns only the whole numbers and rounds down the remainder.
A float is a decimal value.  when dividing a float will return the actual value (rounded off at some number of digits).

*What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?*

I guess I should have read this before answering question 2.  Basically intigers are used for things that can't be split up.  If you need 2 people
to row a boat and you have 5 people, you can only row 2 boats not 2.5, because half a boat would sink! :)

#Relase 2 Code

```
days_in_year=365
hours_in_day=24
years_in_decade=10
min_in_hr=60

hr_in_yr=days_in_year*hours_in_day

min_in_dec=min_in_hr*hr_in_yr*years_in_decade

puts hr_in_yr

puts min_in_dec
```

#Reflection

*How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?*

All matimatical funcitons are actually methods and it expects to add like types of variables.  Some are able to be mixed but others may not give results you expects
unless they are formated to the type you want.

*What is the difference between integers and floats?*

As stated above integers are whole numbers and floats are floating point numbers that can give a portion of a whole number.

*What is the difference between integer and float division?*

See above

*What are strings? Why and when would you use them?*

Strings are groups of characters these can include numbers they are deifined by being inside quotes.

*What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?*

Local variables are to be used within the code for holding values that you need.  They can be changed later in the code.





*How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?*
