*What does puts do?*

`puts` prints to the screen and adds a return ending the line.

*What is an integer? What is a float?*

An integer is a whole number that can be positive or negitive and include 0 when dividing it returns only the whole numbers and rounds down the remainder.
A float is a decimal value.  when dividing a float will return the actual value (rounded off at some number of digits).

*What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?*

I guess I should have read this before answering question 2.  Basically intigers are used for things that can't be split up.  If you need 2 people
to row a boat and you have 5 people, you can only row 2 boats not 2.5, because half a boat would sink! :)

#Relase 2 Code

```
days_in_year=365
hours_in_day=24
years_in_decade=10
min_in_hr=60

hr_in_yr=days_in_year*hours_in_day

min_in_dec=min_in_hr*hr_in_yr*years_in_decade

puts hr_in_yr

puts min_in_dec
```
