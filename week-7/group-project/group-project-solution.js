USER STORIES

As a user I would like...

To take a group of numbers THAT ARE IN NUMERICAL ORDER of any number of inputs and do the following:

-Add them all together when i ask to "sum" the group

-Calulate the average when I ask for the "mean" of the group

-Organize them in order and pick the middle value when I ask for the "median" of the group.

For instance  4, 8, 9 should give 8 as a result 

Note: If there are an even number of values given, average the two in the middle.

For instance 4, 8, 9, 20 should give 8 as a result 8.5
